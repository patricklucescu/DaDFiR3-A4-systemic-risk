    | Create the Bank-to-Firm Loans, Bank-to-Bank Loans and the Bank-to-Bank CDS contracts.

    | The function covers the following steps:

    #. It iterates through each firm, sorting the available loans and attempting to secure one based on credit
    demand and the lending bankâ€™s capacity.

    #. If a bank does not have enough credit or deposit to issue a loan, it seeks an interbank loan.
    The conditions for these loans depend on several factors like financial fragility, policy rate, and calibration
    variables.

    #. The function also handles the creation of CDS contracts, both covered and naked, based on certain probabilities.
    These contracts are established between different banks for each firm, depending on various factors including the
    default probability of the firm and the financial condition of the banks.
